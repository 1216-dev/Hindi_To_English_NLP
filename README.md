# Machine Translation Project (English to Hindi)

This project aims to develop a state-of-the-art machine translation system using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to translate text from English to Hindi. It is built using an Encoder-Decoder architecture that processes the input sequence in English and generates the output sequence in Hindi.

## Introduction
In this project, we developed a machine translation model capable of translating English text into Hindi using deep learning techniques. The model uses an Encoder-Decoder architecture with LSTM networks to learn the mappings between English and Hindi sentence pairs.
